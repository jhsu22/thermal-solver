# Thermal Solver

> Created by **The Nameless** as a project for Cal Poly Pomona's ME 4990 course in Machine Learning and Object Oriented Programming

A Python-based thermal systems solver intended to solve common thermal systems, with support for many commonly seen working fluids, exchanger materials, and arrangements. Simply input fluid and geometry values and calculate valuable information on outlet temperatures, heat transfer, and your heat exchanger!

## Supported Problem Types and Outputs
**Straight Piping**
- Pressure Drop

**Boiling/Condensation (Multiple Layouts!)** 
- Heat Transfer Rate, Conductivity, Condensation Rate

**Double Pipe Heat Exchangers**
- Fluid Outlet Temps, Exchanger Coefficient, Heat Transfer Rate

**Plate and Frame Heat Exchangers**
- Fluid Outlet Temps and Pressures, Exchanger Coefficient, Heat Transfer Rate

**Shell and Tube Heat Exchangers**
- Exchanger Coefficient for both new and 1 y/o fouled exchangers

**Heat Pipes**
- Capillary, Sonic, Entrainment, and Boiling Limits

## How to Run
Clone the git repository in your code editor of choice, and run main.py! 

Users on macOS will not be able to run the app with the custom font without installing it onto your computer

A full desktop release is in the works :)
